Linking is not just organization—it's cognition. By connecting notes, we externalize [[relationships between ideas]], making patterns visible. This mirrors how the brain forms meaning: through associations, not hierarchies.

In [[Niklas Luhmann]]’s [[Zettelkasten]], links created pathways for ideas to evolve and converse. In Nabokov’s index cards, links (via sequence or theme) shaped narrative flow. Tools like [[Obsidian]] make this explicit, letting notes "talk" to each other through backlinks and graph views.

Linking transforms notes from static storage into dynamic thought. It's how isolated fragments become a living, thinking system.
