Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking application that operates on markdown files.

Obsidian allows users to make internal links for notes and then to visualize the connections as a graph.

Obsidian is designed to help users organize and structure their thoughts and knowledge in a flexible, non-linear way.
