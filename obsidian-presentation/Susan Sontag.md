## Use of index cards

Sontag famously used index cards to:

- Capture quotes, reflections, reading notes.

Her archive reveals meticulous use of cards, often categorized and filed for later assembly into larger pieces. This modular thinking helped her bridge fiction, criticism, and cultural commentary.
