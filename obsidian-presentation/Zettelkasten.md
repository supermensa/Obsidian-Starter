**Zettelkasten** (German for "slip box") is a personal knowledge management system developed by sociologist **Niklas Luhmann**.

#### **Core Principles:**

* **Atomic notes**: Each note (Zettel) contains one idea only.
* **Unique ID numbers**: Each note gets an identifier (e.g., 1a2) that allows branching and linking.
* **Contextual linking**: Notes refer to each other, forming a web of ideas.
* **Emergence**: Insights grow from connections, not from top-down planning.
#### **Why it works:**

It mimics natural thinkingâ€”ideas build on each other. Notes become dialogue partners over time. You don't just store knowledge; you grow it.

#### **Modern versions:**

Used digitally in tools like **[[Obsidian]]**, **Logseq**, or **Notion**, often with backlinks replacing manual IDs.
