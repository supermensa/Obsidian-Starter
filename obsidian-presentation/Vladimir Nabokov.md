Vladimir Nabokov (1899–1977) was a Russian-American novelist, best known for *Lolita*. He wrote in both Russian and English, blending rich language with intricate structures. Nabokov was also a lepidopterist and literature professor. His work often explores memory, identity, and obsession.

Nabokov famously wrote his novels on **[[zettelcard-card| index cards]]**, each containing a single scene, idea, or fragment of text. This let him rearrange the structure freely, treating narrative as a modular, nonlinear puzzle. He stored the [[cards in boxes]], allowing for easy shuffling and revision. This method reflected his obsession with precision and control over narrative flow and time.
