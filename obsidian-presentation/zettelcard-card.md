The cards created by [[Niklas Luhmann]] would contain three identifying marks:

- one main idea, organized by a combination of categories
- a keyword index
- direct links between cards.

You want to have each card contain one atomic idea that makes sense by itself.

This is usually a note using your own words defining that idea, with a citation and combination of organized category and keyword. Eventually this growing atomic notes will develop into symbiotic new ideas, and allow you to start to see patterns.

Example of a [[Zettelkasten]] card: [ZK I Zettel 17,11e](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_17-11e_V)
